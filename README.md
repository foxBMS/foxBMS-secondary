# foxBMS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/foxBMS/foxBMS-secondary.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/foxBMS/foxBMS-secondary)

foxBMS is a free, open and flexible development environment to design battery
management systems. It is the first modular open source BMS development
platform.

## foxBMS Project Setup
The foxBMS project consists of several repositories.

The foxConda-installer repository contains the installer for the foxConda
environment. This environment provides all the tools necessary to generate the
documentation, compile the code for the MCUs and flash the generated binaries on
the MCUs (e.g., Python, git, GCC).

The starting point to get foxBMS is the foxBMS-setup
repository (https://github.com/foxBMS/foxBMS-setup), which contains
the general setup files for the foxBMS project. It includes a setup script
(bootstrap.py) which clones all the other needed repositories. The needed
documentation will be generated automatically after these repositories have been
cloned. The generated documentation is found in the directory ./build.
After the bootstrap step, the top project directory (foxBMS-setup) structure
looks like this:

 - foxBMS-setup <dir>
  - .git <dir> *
  - build <dir>
  - foxBMS-documentation <dir>
  - foxBMS-hardware <dir>
  - foxBMS-primary <dir>
  - foxBMS-secondary <dir>
  - foxBMS-tools <dir>
  - FreeRTOS <dir>
  - hal <dir>
  - .gitignore <file> *
  - bootstrap.py <file>
  - build.py <file>
  - CHANGELOG.md <file>
  - clean.py <file>
  - LICENSE.md <file>
  - README.md <file>
  - wscript <file>

* Directories and files with starting full stop are hidden in Windows in default
configuration.

There is a help available by running "python bootstrap.py -h".

## foxBMS Repositories

The foxConda-installer and foxBMS-setup repositories have already been described.

foxBMS is made out of two Microcontroller Units (MCU), named primary and
secondary. The C code for the primary MCU is found in the repository
foxBMS-primary (https://github.com/foxBMS/foxBMS-primary). The C code for the
secondary MCU is found in the repository foxBMS-secondary
(https://github.com/foxBMS/foxBMS-secondary). The Doxygen documentation is
generated from these sources into ./build/primary/doxygen/html and
./build/secondary/doxygen/html respectively. The main file is in both cases
index.html.

The layout and schematic files for the foxBMS hardware are found in the
foxBMS-hardware repository (https://github.com/foxBMS/foxBMS-hardware).

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (hal) for foxBMS is found in the hal-repository
(https://github.com/foxBMS/hal.) The real time operating system (FreeRTOS) for
foxBMS is found in the FreeRTOS-repository (https://github.com/foxBMS/FreeRTOS.)

The tools needed for foxBMS are in the foxBMS-tools-repository
(https://github.com/foxBMS/foxBMS-tools.)

The general documentation files for the foxBMS project are found in the
foxBMS-documentation repository
(https://github.com/foxBMS/foxBMS-documentation). The sphinx documentation is
found in foxBMS-documentation/doc/sphinx while the Doxygen documentation
configuration is found in foxBMS-documentation/doc/doxygen. The Doxygen
documentation itself is found in the software sources of the primary and
secondary microcontroller. The general documentation, rendered from the sphinx
sources is found in ./build/sphinx/foxBMS-documentation/doc/sphinx/html. The
main file is index.html

A generated version of the Sphinx documentation can be found at
http://foxbms.readthedocs.io/. It explains the structure of the
foxBMS hardware, how to install the foxConda environment and how to use foxConda
to compile and flash the sources.

## Building the Sources
For building the software, open a shell and type "python build.py -h". All
available build options will be displayed. The top build directory is ./build.

## Cleaning the ./build-Directory
For cleaning instructions open a shell and type "python clean.py -h". All
available cleaning options will be displayed.
